Practice problems

1.Take the "menu program" you wrote earlier and break it out into a series of calls to functions for each of the menu items.  Add the calculator and "100 bottles of beer" as two different functions that can be called.
2. Make your calculator program perform computations in a separate function for each type of computation.
3. Modify your password program from before to put all of the password checking logic into a separate function, apart from the rest of the program.
