Practice problems

1. Ask the user for two users' ages, and indicate who is older; behave differently if both are over 100.
2. Implement a simple "password" system that takes a password in the form of a number.  Make it so that either of two numbers are valid, but use only one if statement to do the check.
3. Write a small calculator that takes as input one of the four arithmetic operations, the two arguments to those operations, and then prints out the result
4. Expand the password checking program from earlier in this chapter and make it take multiple usernames, each with their own password, and ensure that the right username is used for the right password. Provide the ability to prompt user's again if the first login attempt failed. Think about how easy (or hard) it is to do this for a lot of usernames and passwords. 
5. Think about what kind of language constructs or features would make it easier to add new users without recompiling the password program. (Note: don't feel like you need to solve these problems with the C++ you've learned so far, the goal is to think about how you might use tools we'll pick up in future chapters.)
