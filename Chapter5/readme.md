Practice problems

1. Write a program that prints out the entire lyrics to a full rendition of "99 bottles of beer"15
2. Write a menu program that lets the user select from a list of options, and if the input is not one of the options, reprint the list
3. Write a program that computes a running sum of inputs from the user, terminating when the user gives an input value of 0 
4. Write a password prompt that gives a user only a certain number of password entry attempts—so that the user cannot easily write a password cracker.
5. Try writing each practice problem with each kind of loop—notice which loops work well for each kind of problem.
6. Write a program that displays the first 20 square numbers. 
7. Write a program that provides the option of tallying up the results of a poll with 3 possible values. The first input to the program is the poll question; the next three inputs are the possible answers. The first answer is indicated by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3. The answers are tallied until a 0 is entered. The program should then show the results of the poll—try making a bar graph that shows the results properly scaled to fit on your screen no matter how many results were entered.
