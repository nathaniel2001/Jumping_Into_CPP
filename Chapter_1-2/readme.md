Practice problems

1. Write a program that prints out your name.
2. Write a program that displays multiple lines of text onto the screen, each one displaying the name of one of your friends.
3. Try commenting out each line of code in the first program we created together and see whether the program can compile without it. Look at the errors you  getâ€”do they make any sense? Can you see why they happened because of the line of code you changed?
