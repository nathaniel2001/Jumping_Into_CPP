Practice Problems

1. Implement the source code that turns numbers into English text.
2. Think about how you would go in the opposite direction, reading English text and translating it into source code. Is this easier or harder than the earlier algorithm? How would you handle bad input?
3. Design a program that finds all numbers from 1 to 1000 whose prime factors, when added together, sum up to a prime number (for example, 12 has prime factors of 2, 2, and 3, which sum to 7, which is prime). Implement the code for that algorithm.
